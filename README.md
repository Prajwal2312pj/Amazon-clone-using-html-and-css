## Project Description: Amazon Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the design, structure, and responsiveness of the original site while gaining deeper insights into front-end web development. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project:

### Key Features:
1. **Fully Responsive Design:**
   - Ensures that the layout adapts seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
   
2. **Header & Navigation Bar:**
   - Replicates Amazon's signature header with search functionality, cart icon, and account options.
   
3. **Hero Section:**
   - Created a dynamic banner section showcasing promotions and featured products.

4. **Product Listings:**
   - Displayed product sections in a grid format, similar to the Amazon homepage layout, with visually appealing product cards.

5. **Footer:**
   - Designed a footer with links similar to Amazon's, incorporating multiple columns of information and links.

6. **CSS Styling:**
   - Emphasized on clean and maintainable CSS with organized classes for reusability.
   - Used Flexbox and Grid for layout structure and alignment.

7. **No JavaScript:**
   - Focused solely on HTML and CSS to achieve design objectives without any JavaScript functionality.

### Future Improvements:
- Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., carousel sliders, search bar functionality).
- Integrate back-end services to handle product listings dynamically.
